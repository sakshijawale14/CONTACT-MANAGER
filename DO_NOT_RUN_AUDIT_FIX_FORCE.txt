                    🚨 CRITICAL WARNING 🚨
================================================================================

DO NOT RUN: npm audit fix --force

This command WILL BREAK your React project!

It will:
  ❌ Downgrade react-scripts to 0.0.0 (invalid version)
  ❌ Remove critical dependencies
  ❌ Break your build system
  ❌ Cause compilation errors

The deprecation warnings you see are:
  ✅ HARMLESS - they don't affect your app
  ✅ NORMAL - they're from react-scripts dependencies
  ✅ SAFE TO IGNORE - your app works fine with them

If you already ran it and broke your project:
  1. I've fixed package.json for you
  2. Run: npm install
  3. Run: npm start
  4. NEVER run npm audit fix --force again!
